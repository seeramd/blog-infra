I initially wanted to deploy to an EC2, but I discovered my account was locked (still working on that with AWS support)

Then I successfully deployed resources to Azure, but after some thought, I figured a lot of the features available in an enterprise cloud platform like Azure and EC2 would be overkill.

So I decided to stick with Linode, which will provide just about everything I need for this project for a clear and reasonable price.
